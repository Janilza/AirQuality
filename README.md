# AirQuality
Monitoring system for indoor air quality

The objective was to monitor some physical and chemical parameters of air such as temperature, humidity, heat index, dew point, carbon dioxide, particulate matter and volatile organic compounds. Using a Lattepanda Computer and a four-sensor module, a C # application was building to present the values of the measured air parameters. These are also available on the ThingSpeak.com platform presented in graph form and can be consulted over any browser because it is a cloud-based service. System also has the history of measurements stored on MySQL database.
